# Chess Engine
This is a Proof of Concept (PoC) macOS app focused on creating a fairly basic chess engine based solely on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) of the game, it doesn't cover all aspects of the game and it's limitations are cited bellow

## Features
- All basic moves
- En passe
- check and check mate conditions
- Auto Resizing for the chess board, it calculates a square given the app size
 
## Missing
- Stalemate/Dead Positions
- Castling

### Why?
 As I built this project I noticed that in the end I wasn't really challenging myself with anything, don't get me wrong matrix operations are not ultra easy, but they also weren't teaching me anything, so I left the project in a functional state and I can move on to more interesting things

 ## Building
Should just work, the code was made for macOS 15.1
